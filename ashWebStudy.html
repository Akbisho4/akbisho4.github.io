Another section refers to a a writing by Michael MacBeath (ASU). The cognitive scientist gives two explanations for how a baseball player catches a fly ball. 1) In line with the IP model of human intelligence, the player triangulates the ball's velocity to determine where best to go to catch the ball 2) " to catch the ball, the player simply needs to keep moving in a way that keeps the ball in a constant visual relationship with respect to home plate and the surrounding scenery (technically, in a ‘linear optical trajectory’)."
